Development Document: Data Processing Program


Introduction

his project involves developing a Python-based Data Processing Program that reads numerical data from an input file, performs basic calculations.  The project stays to the provided requirements by ensuring structured Python code, command-line execution, error handling, and clear documentation.
The GitHub repository for this project, which includes the Python script, execution script, sample input data, and this development document, can be found at:

Technical Breakdown of the Code


def read_data(file_path):
    """Reads numerical data from the input file."""
    try:
        with open(file_path, 'r') as file:
            data = [float(line.strip()) for line in file.readlines()]
        return data
    except FileNotFoundError:
        print("Error: File not found.")
        sys.exit(1)
    except ValueError:
        print("Error: Invalid data format. Ensure the file contains only numbers.")
        sys.exit(1)• 


 The function read data() reads numerical values from a file.
•  If the file is missing or contains invalid data (e.g., text instead of numbers), the program exits with an error message.
The Data Processing Program is designed to read numerical values from an input file, perform calculations, and write the results to an output file. It also includes error handling, command-line execution, and automation scripts. Below is a detailed breakdown of the key components and any complicated features.


Reflective Evaluation

This project has been a valuable learning experience in Python programming, command-line scripting, and file handling. One of the most interesting parts was adding error handling to ensure the program could deal with user mistakes, such as missing files or incorrect data formats. This made the program more robust and user-friendly.
At first, I faced challenges when the input file contained non-numeric values, which caused the program to crash. I solved this by using exception handling (try-except) to detect errors and display helpful messages instead of stopping unexpectedly.
Another challenge was making the program work on both Windows and Linux. I had to write two different script files (.bat for Windows and .sh for Linux). This helped me understand how different operating systems handle scripts and commands.
Possible Improvements:
1.	More Calculations – Adding median, standard deviation, and more data analysis.
2.	Better Error Handling – Supporting different file formats like CSV and JSON.
3.	Faster Processing – Using multi-threading for large datasets.
4.	Visual Output – Using matplotlib to create graphs of the data.
Skills to Improve:
•	pandas for better data processing.
•	argparse for improved command-line argument handling.
•	Unit testing to make the program more reliable.
Overall, this project helped me understand Python file handling, automation, and error management, which are important for real-world programming.

This Data Processing Program is a well-structured application that includes:
 Command-line execution – Runs using a script with an input file.
 File handling – Reads input data and writes results safely.
 Error management – Handles missing files and invalid data.
 Basic math operations – Calculates sum and average.
 Automation scripts – Works on both Windows (.bat) and Linux (.sh).
 Reliable structure – Uses if __name__ == "__main__" to control execution.
Future Improvements:
 Support more file formats – CSV, JSON, and more.
 Add more calculations – Median, standard deviation, etc.
 Improve performance – Use multi-threading for large files.
 Graphical output – Create charts with matplotlib.
This project helped me strengthen my Python skills, especially in file handling, automation, and error management, which are valuable in real-world programming.
